# Galasa Managers
This repository contains code relating to Galasa Managers. Managers are the power-houses of Galasa and are used to reduce the amount of boilerplate code within a test and provide proven tool interaction code.
The repository has a hierarchical structure with a "galasa-managers-parent" folder at the top containing a "pom.xml" file, listing all currently available Managers. 
Managers are grouped by type within the parent folder, for example, the "galasa-managers-core-parent" folder contains the code and IVT (Installation Verification Test) tests for the Core Manager and Artifact Manager.
Each Manager comes with its own set of associated IVT tests and Javadoc. 
We're adding new Manager every month. Look at the [summary table of Managers](https://galasa.dev/docs/managers/) for a list of available and planned Managers and to find out what they do.
