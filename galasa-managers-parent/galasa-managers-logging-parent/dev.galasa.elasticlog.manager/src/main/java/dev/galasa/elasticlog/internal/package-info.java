/**
 * ElasticLog Manager
 * 
 * @galasa.manager ElasticLog
 * 
 * @galasa.release.state ALPHA - This Manager is being actively developed. It is subject to change and has not been extensively tested.
 * It is available for Galasa administrators to utilise to experiment with Elastic/Kibana dashboards
 * 
 * @galasa.description
 * 
 * This Manager exports test results to an elastic search endpoint, where the data can be visualized on a Kibana dashboard. 
 * Other Managers can contribute to the information that is exported to Elastic.
 * <br><br>
 * As an absolute minimum, the CPS properties <code>elasticlog.endpoint.address</code> and <code>elasticlog.endpoint.index</code> 
 * must be provided. By default, this Manager only logs automated tests. To enable logging from locally run tests, 
 * <code>elasticlog.local.run.log</code> must be set to true. The bundle must also be loaded by the framework by using 
 * <code>framework.extra.bundles=dev.galasa.elasticlog.manager</code> in bootstrap.properties.
 * <br><br>
 * This Manager provides two ElasticSearch indexes; one of all test data, and one of the latest run for each test case and each 
 * test environment.
 * 
 * @galasa.limitations

 * The Manager logs the following test information:<br>
 * <br>
