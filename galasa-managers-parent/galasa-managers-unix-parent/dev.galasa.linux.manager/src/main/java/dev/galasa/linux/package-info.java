 *                     This Manager provides the tester with the capability to 
 *                     connect to a Linux image as part of a test and to access 
 *                     the command shell. Standard commands can then be run on 
 *                     the image. The Linux Manager has a dependency on the IP Network 
 *                     Manager, which establishes an IP connection to the image.
