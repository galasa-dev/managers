 * @galasa.description
 *
 *  The IP Network Manager enables access to applications over TCP/IP networks for those 
 *  applications whose native communication is over TCP/IP. It can be used by other 
 *  application specific managers that will build upon the basic address capabilities 
 *  provided by the IP Network Manager. 
  * <br><br>
 *  The Manager interrogates the Configuration Properties Store (CPS) to get hostname                  
 *  and port information so that you do not need to hard-code these values into 
 *  your tests. 
 *  <br><br>
 *  
 *  You can view the <a href="https://javadoc.galasa.dev/dev/galasa/ipnetwork/package-summary.html"
 *  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Javadoc documentation for the Manager here</a>.
