# zOS 3270 Manager - Gherkin temporary ALPHA documentation

The following are the Gherkin statements that the zOS 3270 Manager currently supports.  This documentation will only exist until the doc site supports the Gherkin reference.

NOTE, the spacing and capitalisation must be exact at this time.  We will try to add flexibility soon.

### Obtaining a Terminal for use in a feature file

`GIVEN a terminal`

`GIVEN a terminal with id of A`

`GIVEN a terminal tagged PRIMARY`

`GIVEN a terminal with id of A tagged PRIMARY`


There are 4 flavours to the "given a terminal".  you can specify an ID for a terminal so that a feature file can operate multiple terminals in the same feature file.  You can also specify a zOS image tag to influence which image the terminal connects to.

The default ID is A and the default tag is PRIMARY.

In all the following statements,  where you see `terminal` you can leave as default ID of A or code `terminal B` to point to a different terminal.

### Move Cursor
  
`AND move terminal cursor to field "xxxxxx"`

Where xxxxxx is the text in an protected or unprotected field on the screen.

### Terminal keys

`AND press terminal key TAB`

`AND press terminal key CLEAR`

`AND press terminal key ENTER`

`AND press terminal key PFxx` where xx is the PF number

### Type something

`AND type "xxxxxx" on terminal` where xxxxx is what you want to type where the cursor is

`AND type "xxxxxx" on terminal in field labelled "yyyyyy"` where xxxxxx is the what you want to type,  yyyyyy is the field label.  WARNING, this will move the cursor.  It will locate ANY text yyyyyy and then press TAB and then type.

### Wait for the keyboard to unlock

`AND wait for terminal keyboard`

### Wait for text on the screen

`THEN wait for "xxxxxx" in any terminal field`

This will wait for the text to appear on the screen on any screen update.  WARNING, the keyboard may not be unlocked when this statement finishes.

### Check single text on screen

`THEN check "xxxxxx" appears only once on terminal`

This will search the screen for text xxxxxx and ensure it occurs once.  This is immediate, will not wait for updates.
